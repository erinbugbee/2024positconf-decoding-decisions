# Optimal Stopping Problem

::: notes
-   Mathematically optimal solution for calculating the optimal stopping point
:::

...

**Question:**

. . .

When should I stop searching?

. . .

**Answer:**

. . .

<div>

{{< fa calculator title="Calculator" >}}

</div>

## Explore-Exploit Tradeoff

-   Balancing:

    -   Gathering information through search – ***exploration*** {{< fa map-location-dot title="Map" >}}

    -   Leveraging known information – ***exploitation*** {{< fa bullseye title="Bullseye" >}}

## Decoding Human Decision Making

1.  Predicting human behavior using Python {{< fa brands python title="Python" >}}
2.  Running human experiments {{< fa flask title="Flask" >}}
3.  Analyzing data in R {{< fa brands r-project title="R Project" >}}

# Predicting Human Behavior Using Python {{< fa brands python title="Python" >}}

## Build Decision Making Environment

-   Represent a decision making task through Python code

## Cognitive Modeling

-   Algorithms representing the human cognitive process

-   Used to simulate human decisions, make predictions

-   Use [PyIBL](http://pyibl.ddmlab.com) Python library

## PyIBL

![](images/pyibl.png)

## Simulate Agents

-   Optimal Agent as a baseline

-   Cognitive Agent as a proxy for humans

```{python}
#| eval: false
import pyibl 
a = pyibl.Agent(["action", "value", "dist_from_end"], "Optimal Stopping Agent")
```

# Running Behavioral Experiments with Human Participants {{< fa flask title="Flask" >}}

## Develop Experiment

-   Create tasks that replicate real-world decisions

-   Integrate into Qualtrics survey

-   Tools:

    -   Javascript, HTML, CSS, Qualtrics

## Optimal Stopping Experiment

![](images/experiment2_outcome.mov){height="800" fig-align="center" height="600"}

## Collect Data

-   Participants through online platforms

-   Tools:

    -   Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific

# Analyzing Behavior Using {{< fa brands r-project title="R Project" >}}

## Analyze Data and Report

-   Export data as csv from Qualtrics and stored from Javascript experiment

-   Analyze in a reproducible Quarto document

-   Figures using ggplot2

## Results

## People stop searching too early

-   People tend to stop too early, underexplore

-   More knowledge leads to earlier stopping, less exploration than less knowledge

# Conclusion

## The Right Tool

-   

## Exploration at posit::conf

-   If this is your first posit::conf...

    -   There are lots of new people, technologies, topics to learn

-   If you have attended many times before....

    -   You likely have made connections, know which sessions are of interest

## Keep Exploring

-   Meet new people, learning new things, see a new place

-   Don't stop your search too early!
